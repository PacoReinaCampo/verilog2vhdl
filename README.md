**Implementation in C (Flex & Bison) of a translator from (System)Verilog to VHDL**

Hardware Description Language (HDL) is a specialized computer language used to describe the structure and behavior of digital logic circuits. It allows for the synthesis of a HDL into a netlist, which can then be synthesized, placed and routed to produce the set of masks used to create an integrated circuit.
